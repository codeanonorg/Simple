Websites made simple

## A Simple introduction

Writing websites may be painful. There's a ton of frameworks and complicated tools available. **Simple** comes back to plain HTML and bring a nice tool to structure static websites in a minute.

**Simple** is based on the idea of defining html components and to compose them to make bigger components. Any HTML file is a valid **Simple** component. **Simple** is just here to compile your html code base, add a bit of html magic to it and give you back some good old plain HTML. There is no JavaScript in the process, no runtime over-head, no tons of css framework being embedded. It's all about you and your HTML.

## Simple examples

**Simple** is ... well .. *simple* to use. Plug in your html file and just wait, but not too long, it's only copy-pasting code.
```bash
$ python -m Simple examples/main.html
```
